		<h2>Rise In Popularity</h2>

		<p class="note">Helvetica was designed in post-war Europe, and many companies were looking for a change. It was the opposite of all the kitschy, fancy, decorative typography that covered corporate materials and advertisements.<br><br>Corporations stick by Helvetica because of what they have invested in it. Because of this, it has become associated with corporate culture and business to some degree. This is one reason why American Apparel chose to use the font for their own brand identity to poke fun at corporate culture in America.</p>

		<h1>Technical Details of Helvetica.</h1>
		
		<h3>Technically, Helvetica is a very interesting font. There are a few things that set it apart from many other sans serif fonts, and make it unique.</h3>
		<ul>
				<li>Helvetica’s characters always have vertical or horizontal terminations on their strokes, never diagonal.</li>
				<li>Helvetica is as much about the negative space surrounding the letters than about the lines that make up the characters themselves.</li>
				<li>The negative space contained within the lowercase “a” closely resembles a teardrop.</li>
				<li>It has monotone stroke weights.</li>
				<li>It remains legible when in motion, one reason it’s popular for signage and automaker and airline logos.</li>
			</ul>

		<h1>A Brief History of Helvetica</h1>
		<h3><strong>Designed By: Max Miedinger and Eduard Hoffmann </strong></h3>
		<p>
		The original <a href="http://www.linotype.com/1308886/helvetica-family.html" target="_blank">Helvetica</a> was designed in Switzerland in 1957 by Max Miedinger and Eduard Hoffmann at the Haas type foundry (Haas’sche Schriftgiesserei). Haas was controlled by the type foundry Stempel, which was in turn controlled by Linotype.

		<p>
		Helvetica was originally called Die Neue Haas Grotesk, and was closely based on Schelter-Grotesk. It was created specifically to be neutral, to not give any impression or have any meaning in itself. This neutrality was paramount, and based on the idea that type itself should give no meaning.

		</div>
		<p>
		The marketing director at Stempel decided to change the name to Helvetica in 1960 to make the font more marketable internationally. Originally it was proposed that the typeface be called Helvetia (Latin for Switzerland), but the designers didn’t want to name it after a country, and so it was called Helvetica instead (which is Latin for Swiss).
